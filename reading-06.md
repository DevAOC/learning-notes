### JS Intro Paragraph

Javascript is a programming language with First-class functions. This means that the functions in this language are treated like any other variable. This also means that a function can be passed to another function as an argument.

### Input and Output in JS

Javascript is the backbone of the website. In Javascript, we write algorithms which can be called in the HTML file you create to help facilitate the flow and design of your webpage.

As shown on [https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript](https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript), you are able to create buttons or other tools which make your site more accessible.

### Variables

Variables are a declared using either the var, const, or let keywords. Var stands for variable, as const stands for a non changing constant variable (cannot be modified after being given a value), and let being a changable variable.

Identifiers are the name of the variable. Rules for identifiers are:

- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- Must begin with a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore
- They are case sensitive
- Reserved words such as Javascript keywords cannot be used as names

The assignment operator is an equals sign (=). There is also an equal to operator that is two consecutive equals signs (==).

You may declare variables together:

```Javascript

var person="Jane Doe", carName="Lamborghini", price="100000"

```
