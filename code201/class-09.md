## HTML & CSS

### Chapter 7: Forms

A form works by allowing a user to input information in to boxes and submitting by clicking a button. The information is then sent to a server and stored in a database.

Within a form tag there must always be an action attribute. This attribute is the URL of the page that will be recieving the information. There are two methods you can use to sent your form. These are:

- get

Get is used when your form is short or you dont need to add or delete something from a database.

- post

Post is for the latter; when you need to modify the contents of a database or your form is long.

The way we enter information into the form is by using the input tag. In you are using an input tag you must use the name attribute to designate what property is being given a value.

### Chapter 14: Lists, Tables, and Forms

Tables can be modified just like any object in HTML. Using CSS you can modify these tags using properties like:

- Padding
- Letter-spacing, font size
- Background color

Similar styling can be done to tables.
