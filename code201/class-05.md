You add images using the <img> tag. Using the src attribute you link the image file to your tag. You may also add something called alternative text to describe what the image is in case it doesn't load. Example:

``` Javascript

<img src="images/Cordon-Bleu-Grad.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="300"/> <img src="images/CB100_logo-retina.jpeg" alt="drawing" align="top" width="500"/>

```
