# Class 01 Notes

## HTML & CSS

### Chapter 1: Structure

#### Tags

HTML is used as a skeleton for the information in the page. Elements are used to allows readers, search engines, and programmers better understand the layout and information given on a web page. These elements have tags which usually come in pairs, with one exception. Elements will always have an opening and closing tag unless the opening tag is also a self-closing tag. For example:

Opening and closing tag:

``` HTML

<a href="#Readings-&-Notes">Readings & Notes</a>

```

Self-closing tag:

``` HTML

<img src="images/Cordon-Bleu-Grad.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

```

The characters in the brackets indicates the tag's purpose.

#### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. Attributes are found inside the opening tag. As you can see above, attributes come in many ways.

The two propteries of an attribute are the name and value. The name indicates what kind of additional information will be provided and should be written in lower case. The value should be placed in quotations.

### Chapter 8: Extra Markup

Extra markup examples:

#### DOCTYPE

There has been several different versions of HTML and all of them have had different standards for functioning. The use of the DOCTYPE declaration allows the webpage to function correctly by declaring that the webpage the browser is about to run, follows HTML5 standards.

#### Comments

A comment is used in HTML, and coding in general, to help understand the code that is in a specific section. People that have not written a section of code but need to quickly look at it in order to understand what is going on, will read the comments and decifer the code with it. A comment in HTML looks like this:

``` HTML
