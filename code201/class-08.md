### Chapter 15: Layout

This is a repeat of the Class 4 reading.

Z-index:

This is a tool to decide which element will be on top when there are many elements overlapping. The higher the value of the z-index, the closer the element will be to the front of view. 

There are two types of layouts:

- Fixed Width Layout

This layout is one that haves precisely designated sizes for boxes and placement of the elements.

- Liquid Layout

This type of layout moves with the size of the page. It will not always behave as you want when the page size is changed.
