### What is CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is what allows you to modify the look of the webpages you create in HTML. CSS uses selectors such as class and id to allow you to target specific points in your HTML code.

#### CSS Syntax

CSS syntax opens with a selector (h1, section, article, etc) followed by {...} which encases arguments. The arguments encased within the {} are what modify the look and feel of the page. There are many arguments ranging from color to animations!

A class is always written using a period (.) character between the selector and class name. For example:

``

    h1.class-name-example {
        ...
    }

    h2#id-name-example {
        ...
    }

``

These are specific to making a change to the content of h1 or h2 tag with their respective class or id. For example:

``

    <h1 class="class-name-example">
        ...
    </h1>

    <h2 id="id-name-example">
        ...
    </h2>

``
