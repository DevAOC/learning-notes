## nosql vs sql

SQL (Structured Query Language):

- Relational Databases
- Table based databases
- Predefined schema
- Vertically scalable
- MongoDB is an SQL database

NoSQL:

- Non-relational Databases
- Document based
- Dynamic schema
- Focused on collections of documents

NoSQL databases are good for hierarchical data storage.

SQL databases are better for scalability because you can upgrade the parts on one server to improve the speed.

## Video

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

A relational database is one that works with assumptions. This kind of database works with tables.

A schema is a field that allows you to specify what data you want to be using.

The best example of a NoSQL database is MongoDB. NoSQL databases are databases that use collections. These collections have documents which look like JSON.

MongoDB is more flexible because there are no relations and you dont have to have the exact same schema.
