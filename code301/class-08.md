## API Design Best Practices

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

2. REST APIs are designed around resources. This can be objects, data or services.

3. A resource identifier is a unique URL to this resource.

4. The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. URLs should be based on,

6. https://adventure-works.com/orders is an example of a good URL.

7. Having a 'chatty' API means that it takes more than one call to get the information you requested from that API. It is best to avoid having a chatty API.

8. A successful GET returns the code 200 OK.

9. An unsuccessful GET returns 404 'not found'.

10. A successful POST returns code 201.

11. A successful DELETE returns code 204.
