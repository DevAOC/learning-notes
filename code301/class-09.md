## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

A module is a bit of code that is split up from the main app. It is split so that it is only loaded and used once called upon.

The word require is used to say that we require the module that you specified within your app.

You can bring another file, into the one you are currently working, you must use the module.exports within your module and spcify which functions to export.

You need to make a variable that is equal to the required module in order to make the module available.
