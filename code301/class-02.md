## React Lifecycle

Between render and componentDidMount, rendering is the first to happen. The first thing to happen once a React app is run is the construction.
In order, constructor goes first, followed by render, then React updates, and finally componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount if it is needed. ComponentDidMount is invoked after the component is mounted. It is used to connect to an API and get information.

## React Bootsrtap

This is a framework used to make CSS properties and change the look of your page using Javascript. You must import just like in regular React.

## Netlify

This helps you design your website just like bootstrap.
