## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

Node.js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome V8 Javascript engine. Chrome V8 is an open sourced Javascript engine. It is used for calling APIs and does not run within the browser. Runtime means exactly that; Javascript is run locally and not online. Npm stands for Network Package Manager. It is used to download and use open source tools and code.

On my machine I am running versions:

Node 14.17.0

npm 7.20.6

The command you need to use to install jshint in npm is:

npm install -g jshint

Node is used to run Javascript on a server and to run it locally.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

The six reasons for pair programming are:

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

In my experience, work environment readiness is what I have found most beneficial. I cannot relate with the other reasons. Pair programming is done by sitting together and one person explaining what needs to be done.
