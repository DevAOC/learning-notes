- Replaceability: The component can be switched out with other components easily
- No context specificity: The component is designed to work in different environments
- Extensibility: Can be extended from existing components to end with different behaviors
- Encapsulation: Functionallity is usable without showing its inner workings
- Independibility: Designed to have minimal dependability on other components

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

The code that is made as a component is easier to deploy, reliability, independency, technical complexity.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

### What is props short for?

Props is a keyword in React that stands for properties. Props is used to pass data from one component to another.

### What is the flow of props?
