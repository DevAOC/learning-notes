# Reading Notes 01

## Read: Mastering Markdown on GitHub

This reading offers a basic syntax guide for beginner coders in Markdown. The syntax provided includes:
- Headers
- Emphasis
- Lists
  - Ordered
  - Unordered
- Images
- Links
- Blockquotes
- Inline Code

There is also a seperate section involved with more advanced/special Markdown referred to as GitHub Flavored Markdown. This list of syntax includes:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Task Lists
- Tables
- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) References
- Issue References within a Repository
- Username @mentions
- Automatic Linking for URLs
- Strikethrough
- Emojis

All these tools and syntax have been used on my main page "reading-notes" and on this page as well!

## Watch: GitHub Pages

In this video and on this page, we learned about the benefits of using GitHub to share code and projects easily. GitHub allows us to present code in a neat fashion and link all of our projects and information on one webpage, made by the developers themselves. It is easily accessible and just as easy to learn!
