# Reading Notes 01

## Read: Mastering Markdown on GitHub

This reading offers a basic syntax guide for beginner coders in Markdown. The syntax provided includes:
- Headers
- Emphasis
- Lists
  - Ordered
  - Unordered
- Images
- Links
- Blockquotes
- Inline Code

There is also a seperate section involved with more advanced/special Markdown referred to as GitHub Flavored Markdown. This list of syntax includes:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Task Lists
- Tables
- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) References
- Issue References within a Repository
- Username @mentions
- Automatic Linking for URLs
- Strikethrough
- Emojis

All these tools and syntax have been used on my main page "Growth Mindset ðŸ“ˆ" and on this page as well!

Simple Markdown Examples:

```Markdown

Making headers:

# Growth Mindset ðŸ“ˆ

### Reminders

##### Class 01

Bolding text with double asterisk:

## Watch: GitHub Pages

In this video and on this page, we learned about the benefits of using GitHub to share code and projects easily. GitHub allows us to present code in a neat fashion and link all of our projects and information on one webpage, made by the developers themselves. It is easily accessible and just as easy to learn!

## Bookmark: GitHub Markdown Syntax

This is a link to all the exciting syntax and inline code you can include on any of the GitHub pages you create! It is possible to use inline HTML instead of Markdown to achieve the same or even more ambitious goals on any site you create.

For example:

```HTML
  <a style="color: green;" href="https://devaoc.github.io/reading-notes/">Main Page</a>
```

This snippet of HTML inline code, would provide a green link to my my main repository page with the text "Main Page". There are many more tips and tricks to discover using the link [https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
