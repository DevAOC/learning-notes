This style of wireframe is done simply with paper and markers. These are very basic sketches used to give a general idea of the layout.

These are both made up of the fundemental shapes to represent the key elements of the web page and they are usually made in black, white, and grey. It is important to keep them as simple as possible because too much detail can be distracting.

Wireframes are usually begun as hand-drawn sketches and then moved to digital wireframes to be more easily shared with other developers.
