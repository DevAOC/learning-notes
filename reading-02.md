## Read: Choosing a Text Editor

In this reading, the author of the article, offered up good advice on how to choose a text editor. He spoke of the basic editors that come with anyones' operating system such as Text Edit or Notepad. In these text editors, there are no special features. They do not help with syntax highlightinga nd code completion. Neither do they provide the user with themes or useful extensions.

A list of text editors used in the developer world today are:

- VS Code
- Atom
- Sublime Text
- Notepad++
- BB Edit

These text editors come with helpful features and extensions.

I have personally used Sublime Text in the past and grew fond of it before being introduced to VS Code. My personal preferences are to these two editors.
