## Read: Choosing a Text Editor

In this reading, the author of the article, offered up good advice on how to choose a text editor. He spoke of the basic editors that come with anyones' operating system such as Text Edit or Notepad. In these text editors, there are no special features. They do not help with syntax highlightinga nd code completion. Neither do they provide the user with themes or useful extensions.

A list of text editors used in the developer world today are:

- VS Code
- Atom
- Sublime Text
- Notepad++
- BB Edit

These text editors come with helpful features and extensions.

I have personally used Sublime Text in the past and grew fond of it before being introduced to VS Code. My personal preferences are to these two editors.

## Read Carefully:

A command prompt or terminal is a window only cosisting of text that allows you to navigate your computer without using a GUI (Graphical User Interface). The basic layout of a terminal starts with a prompt, then command, and finally command line arguments. The terminal will return an output followed by another prompt.

#### The Bash Shell

There are various shells available and the most common shell is called **Bash** (Bourne again shell). The way to check which shell you are using is to use the command **echo**. This command will output the current shell you are using in the terminal.
