## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. The headers that are used in authentication and authorization are a token with an encoded secret, username, and password. This helps the information being passed from the client to the server to be secret.
2. The stuff that is save to put in a JWT are a secret, a token, username, and password that are all encrypted.
3. JWTs are validated using decoding software that will also be used to verify and confirm the token.

## Terms

- RBAC: This is basic access control which is defined by roles.
- User Roles: User roles are defined by the programmer and allows certain users to have permissions when interacting with the server.
- JWT: A JWT is the token that consists of information to be passed to the server and to be authenticated. To be authenticated they must be valide and not have any tampering.
