# Class 03 Notes

## Review, Research, Discussion

1. 3 Real World Applications for middleware are: logging information to the console; error reporting before continuing to the rest of the application; routing
2. False: Route handlers are not considered middleware.
3. Middleware can a process by using the res.end() function which terminates the req, res cycle and sends back the information given to res.
4. You can inject middleware in the middle of an incoming request
5. This error happens when you try to send more than one response to the client

## Preview

1. I have learned about routing before and always feel like I need more clarity in it. I also feel that I need clarity in how to make changes to a SQL database.
2. I am hoping to learn more about the CRUD operations with SQL databases. I worked on it a lot in the lab and feel like I have a good grasp but want a deeper understanding. I would like to be able to learn more about how to test properly. I need to learn testing better so that it doesnt slow me down when I am writing code for labs, projects, and later at my job.
3. I have a general interest in learning the best algorithms and techniques to employ in my Javascript.
