1. The Web Request Response Cycle is a term for one computer making requests for information to be sent back to it. We use CRUD and REST all the time in programming when connecting to APIs.
2. A server is a program that will be taking requests from a client and sending it to an API. It will then recieve the response from that API and send it back to the client program.
3. Deploying an application means that you are hosting it on a site with 3rd party sites that will help run your builds.
