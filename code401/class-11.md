# Class 11 Notes

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. ACL is important because it helps restrict access to users that dont have the role required to do certain CRUD.
2. An application that would need ACL is one that has multiple roles. For instance, if you made a password app where multiple users have access to the same passwords but cant modify them.
3. A role is used to allow certain permissions for certain user models.
4. Role based control is easier to scale because it is defined and has one value to check when determining permissions.

## Terms

- Capabilities: These are the permissions you give to a role that is linked to a user model.
- Role Based Access Control: Using this allows you decide which users can do what activities.
- Authorization: This is the capability to perform certain CRUD features, determined by roles.
