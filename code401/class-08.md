# Class 08 Notes

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. You would use basic auth when signing in to a profile amd trying to retreive basic information. You would use bearer auth when trying to make sure that the user, trying to collect deep information, is allowed and is not trying to manipulate or see what is in the req.
2. The JSON Web Token package allows you to use token authentication in your code.
3. When making a SECRET, we should make sure that the SECRET is unique and kept secret.

## Terms

- Token: A token is a special line of encrypted data that allows a server to verify a user.
- JSON Web Token: The package, JSON Web Token, is a package that allows you to get and use tokens to verify the identity of the user.
- Secret: This is a special string that is defined by the devs for use in a token. It makes the sent information more secure.
- Bearer: Bearer means that it is the person with the specific token that is allowed to use data from the database.
