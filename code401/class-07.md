1. Proper order for tokens is:
2. With an auth code we are able to make sure that the person that is attempting to access our database, is allowed to do so.
3. With an access token you are able to verify if there was any tampering while a request was being sent to the server/databse.
4. The benefits of usiong OAuth vs your own authentication is that OAuth is more secure beccause they have better encoding and encryption.

## Terms

- Router Middleware: A router is a software module that helps direct paths for specific operations.
- Dynamic Module Loading: This means that modules and tasks are done dynamically by writing code that can accept random bits of information to fill gaps in code. Basically filling a variable with a value in order to complete some predefined processes.
- Singleton Pattern: This is the singular flow of data almost like iterating through a for loop.
- Mock Testing: This is testing used to see if your code will work. Using fake data to test functions.
