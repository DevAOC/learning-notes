1. The benefits of transforming data into packets is that it takes less space when sending that information through the network. (Less bandwidth use)
2. It is considered a connectionless protocol because it allows information to be sent before there is an arguement from the recieving party.
3. A server can hace multiple socket connections as long as the client is using multiple sockets on their end.
4. This is the same when talking about an app connection to two other socket apps/servers.
5. Yes you can have both a socket connection and a socket server in one app.
