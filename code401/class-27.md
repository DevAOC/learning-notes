# Class 27 Notes

## Review, Research, and Discussion

React differs from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS because it is almost like a melding of all three plus ES6. It allows users to write HTML within JS and even inline style. You may also import styles from a seperate file. 2. Functional components and class components differ in structure. In a functional component you dont need to use a constructor and it uses hooks instead of using the setState method.

## Terms

- Functional Components: These are React components that are defined as functions rather than a class.
- Children/Child Components: Children are the components that are helping/lower level than a component that uses it.
