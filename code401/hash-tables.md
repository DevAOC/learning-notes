# Hash Tables Notes

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. We use hash tables as libraries becasue they are easier to reference. You don't need to use an iterative approach to call on the contents of a hashtable. Lookups take O(1) time complexity.

## Terms

- Hash: In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets: Each index of an array is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions: A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
