## Reading and Reference Material

- Solving Problems
- Act Like You Make $1000/hr
- How to Think Lake a Programmer
- The 5 Whys

All of these readings contained information about how to solve programming problems. Each shared a set of steps on how to approaching writing code. For example:

- Start by understanding and making sure the problem is clear in your mind
- Manually write a step of steps to accomplish the goal of the problem
- Write pseudo code that more precisely tackles what will need to be written in code
- Write the code
- Improve the code

There was also mention on how to narrow down the precise problem in 'The 5 Whys' reading. This was to ask a question on why a problem is a problem and to tackle the root cause of the problem to fix the overall.

## Videos

### What the Heck is the Event Loop Anyway

In this video, there was an explanation on how the event loop and callback queue works. It was explained using synchronous and asynchronous functions. The point was to show how the stack worked and what happened when you used an asynchronous function.

This being said, asynchronous functions are put into a queue to be run once the rest of the stack has been cleared.

### The Super Mario Effect

The Super Mario Effect talks about how failure viewed in different ways than the traditional 'you suck' method, can positively impact the way that one learns a new skill.

Trying over and over will help you learn and understand where your setbacks were. As Mark Rober stated, framing challenges in this way will have varied results but in the end you will have success.
