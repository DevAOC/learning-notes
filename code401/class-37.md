# Class 37 Notes

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Redux makes it a lot easier to store state at the top level of the program without having to make it a parent of the otehr components.
2. The purpose of a reducer is to add things on to each other depending on a callback.
3. An action contains a set of instrucitons to be done in order to change state.
4. We need to copy the state in the reducer so that it doesnt get mutated.

## Terms

- Immutable State: State that is not truly modified and has a previous version of itself.
- Time Travel in Redux: This is a reference to debugging state.
- Action Creator: An action creator is a piece of code that changes the state.
- Reducer: The function that helps to modify the state.
- Dispatch: The handler that activates the state changing.
